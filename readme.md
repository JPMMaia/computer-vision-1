# Computer Vision Course

This project contains the source code of five different assignments done for a computer vision course:

1. Merge and alignment of three different images, each corresponding to a different color chanel (R, G, B).
2. K-means clustering applied to images.
3. Implementation of a scale-invariant blob detector, based on the Laplacian blob detector.
4. Image stitching using SIFT features.
5. Scene recognition using a bag of visual words and SIFT features.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

* MATLAB

### Usage

1. Get a copy of the source code of this repository by cloning it using Git or simply by downloading it.
2. To test an assignment, run the code of the file that starts with *test* located at the corresponding *Source* folder.
3. The tests take as input the images located at the *Resources* folder. Check the results, by looking into the *Output* folder. Note that in some cases, the results may differ between runs (e.g. K-means clustering results).

## Built With
