# Computer Vision Course

This project contains the source code of five different assignments done for a computer vision course:

1. Merge and alignment of three different images, each corresponding to a different color chanel (R, G, B).
2. K-means clustering applied to images.
3. Implementation of a scale-invariant blob detector, based on the Laplacian blob detector.
4. Image stitching using SIFT features.
5. Scene recognition using a bag of visual words and SIFT features.
